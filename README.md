About this code:
This is a self-contained HTML webpage.
It teaches/explains Data Models and DBMS Architecture using both text and visuals.
It uses:
HTML → to structure the content (headings, sections, diagrams, examples).
CSS (inside <style>...</style>) → to make it look modern, clean, and visually appealing.
No external libraries (pure HTML + CSS only).
So, when opened in a browser, this file displays an educational webpage that compares different data models and architectures in DBMS.
It helps beginners quickly understand the difference between data models.
This code generates a mini educational website to visually explain DBMS Data Models (Relational, Hierarchical, Network, Document) and 
Architectures (Centralized, Client–Server). It was likely made for teaching, assignments, or self-learning. 
The diagrams are made with just HTML <div> boxes styled by CSS.
